    <h1>Things about me</h1>
    <section id="about_me" class="section">
      <p class="me">There are a lot of things that I do/used to do and things that I like so this is a summary of them.</p>
      <section id="music">

        <h2 class="musicheader">My Music Taste</h2>
        <p>I like all kinds of music but some of my top artists include:</p>
        <p>Justin Timberlake(mostly his 2006 era and before). I'm actually going to his concert over the summer this year. My favorite album of his is FutureSex/LoveSounds.</p>
        <p class="taste">Childish Gambino, My Morning Jacket(I went to their concert last November, it was amazing), MARINA, Roan Martin, Jhariah, and many more. There are also artists where I only enjoy one or two songs.</p>
      </section>
      <h2>Sports</h2>
      <p class="sports">I used to play a lot of different sports growing up including track & field, soccer, volleyball, figure skating, and ballet. For track & field, I specialized in sprints. Mostly the 200 meter dash and the 400 meter run.</p>

        <h2 class="drawingheader">Drawing</h2>
        <p>I got into drawing as early as 2nd grade and ever since I've only improved. I only do it as a hobby and when the motivation/inspiration is high but regardless I enjoy it a lot. Here are some drawings I've done. I mostly draw traditional and attempt to draw digitally but it never ends up good.</p>
